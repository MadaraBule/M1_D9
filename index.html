    REQUIREMENTS GATHERING / ANALYSISI / DISCOVERY PHASE
    (Analysts / Business partners/ UX Designers)
    All the stake holders involved in project must be included in this phase.

    Let's think just the first features we need to make it functional.
    MVP: minimum viable product.
    Then we will build the rest of the features in future releases.

    FEATURES & WHY (In form of user stories):
    Select a day, because i wan to set up a meeting on that day.
    Vissualize the appointments/meetings for the selected date.



    As an user of the calendar,I need to be able to select a day, because I want to setup a meeting on that day.

    ASSUMPTION:
    To start with, lets jus build a simple callendar for events only, no reminders noother things.

    NICE TO HAVE FEATURES:
    Having also reminders implemented
    exporting/importing events
    etc...

    UI / UX DESIGN:

    SOFTWARE DESIGN PHASE:
    (Software architects/ software developers)

    Design the way in which we are going to build a software: main componenents, functions, modules, etc...

    In this case we gonna talk about:

    MAIN HTML ELEMENTS:
    Title for the callendar,
    divs for the days, div for the month a (container).
    div for the area where to input event t=details and save the event.
    h1 / h3 to title these sections & inputs
    input tags to input event details, (time input/ text imput for time & names) & a button to save.
    appointmements for the day section: title & a list of events (<ul>) or similar

    MAIN STYLES:
    Main style for the body: background image,black font, align center, etc...
    Days: a highlight when selected, (border, etc.)
    month: a container with a border to make visible that it is surrounding the days.
    title style: same colour(example black), uppercases, bold.
    inputs & buttons: same colour as the titles, etc.
